# Development Plan: Adding a Menu

## Objective
To add a basic navigation menu to the client-side application.

## Assumptions
*   The "menu" refers to a user-facing navigation menu within the web application.
*   The menu will initially contain placeholder links.

## Steps

1.  **Create a new Menu Component:**
    *   File: `packages/client/source/components/Menu.tsx`
    *   Content: A simple React functional component rendering a navigation bar with basic links (e.g., Home, Music, Settings).

2.  **Integrate Menu into Main Application:**
    *   File: `packages/client/source/app.tsx`
    *   Action: Import the `Menu` component and render it, likely at the top of the main application layout.

3.  **Verification (Automated):**
    *   Run the client application's build command (`npm run build` or `npm run dev` if it includes a build step) to check for compilation errors.

## Execution Notes
*   Ensure proper React import and export statements.
*   Maintain existing code style and conventions.
